Remember the temperature conversion stuff you have already coded, now is your chance to make that into a working web page!

Your challenge, make an online temperature converter.

## Recommended steps

- Create a new folder and git hub project and copy over your temperature converter code.
- With a piece of paper, sketch out what you want your web page to look like, where the temperature is inserted, how you choose your units, and where you see the output. Get a feel for how you want it to look on the page, how big the text is etc.
- Sketch out the basic structure of your HTML. First draw a box for the body, then for the main divisions of the page, and subsequent divisions until you reach your text boxes. Start thinking about the `id` names you will give these divisions.
- Sketch out what the JavaScript will need to do and how you will handle different conversion functions and how the website will identify which function it wants to use.
- Create a Code Pen to see what things are looking like without having to save and refresh a browser.
- Built out your basic HTML and CSS.
- Get your JavaScript talking to your HTML by getting the text from the input boxes.
- You may have to re-write or re-factor a lot of your JavaScript depending on what design you have gone for.
- Get a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) working. That is a very basic and ugly version of the page, but something that works. Then iterate over it making it better and better.
- Publish it on GitHub Pages and show the world!

## Stretch Goals, for The Brave

- What other conversion tasks are there? Maybe add in a tool to convert centimeters to inches. Or Hours, Minutes and seconds to milliseconds. How can you integrate them into your site.
- Make a calculator to live on the same page. This can be a project in and of itself. You may wish to create a new project for the calculator, and then lift it and paste it into the conversion site.
- Integrate a trigonometry calculator. There are many variations, but you could for example have a triangle drawn on screen, and have the user input the two short sides and for the page to display the length of the hypotenuse.
- Make a game to practice times tables. This can also be a project in and of itself.
- You can bring together all math related tools you might make into one page or various interlinked pages. You might even find these useful about your day to day life!
