Now put some of your skills in requests to use.

Your challenge is to create a single page application that serves as an API explorer for an API of your choice. It should be a page that has text boxes, or drop down lists, where someone can easily make an API call without having to know about XMLHttpRequests, asynchronicity, JavaScript, HTML and all that stuff that you will shortly be an expert in. A web page where they can for example, if you choose the country API. Choose a country and see a bunch of information pop up on screen and be able to explore that info.

## Recommended Steps

- Choose a free API that doesn't require authentication.
- With some paper sketch out some ideas of what kind of requests you could make to this API.
- Keep on sketching and design a layout for the site. Where the inputs are, what kind of inputs they are, and where the information is displayed and how its displayed.
- Keep on sketching and design what your HTML and JavaScript will need to be able to do and how they will talk to each other.
- Sketch out what your overall HTML structure will be.
- Code your bare bones HTML and CSS.
- Code your JavaScript.
- Get a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) working. That is, a super basic and ugly version of what you want, working. Once you have that, it becomes much easier to iterate and make it pretty. If you try and do everything at once, you'll inevitably find yourself in a pickle.
- Identify some milestones for MVP version 2 and 3, and get there.
- Publish it on GitHub Pages and show the world!

## Stretch Goal, for the Brave

- Can you make the background color, or other stylistic elements of your page respond to the users actions? For example, when a request comes back ok, the background could go green. Or if you get an error, the background could go red.
- Can you show hints for common errors. For example, if the server returns a "Bad Request" error, can you make the page show some hints on how to solve it?
