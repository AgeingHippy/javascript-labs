 * Now that you can `try` executing code and `catch` the errors so that they
 * don't stop the program. Try implementing that into your temperature converter
 * that deals with objects. Make a copy of the object and mess with it a little.
 * Try spelling Fahrenheit or Celsius wrong in a few entries, or put in a string
 * where a number is meant to be. Try running your existing script and see what
 * happens. Once you get an error, try implement the try-catch block somewhere
 * in your code to effectively skip over that entry.
