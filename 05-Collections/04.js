/**
 * Remember how you put the temperature converter functions to use when
 * converting a list of values? Well, now you will get to do the same for a
 * large object!
 *
 * Your challenge:
 *
 *
 * 1. You'll find a huge JSON file in this folder. Copy the contents of that
 *    file below and start writing your script below that.
 * 2. Output to the console all the temperatures in Vancouver in Celsius.
 * 3. Output to the console all the temperatures in Jerusalem in Fahrenheit.
 * 4. Get the average temperatures for Vancouver and Jerusalem in both Celsius
 *    and Fahrenheit and output them to the console.
 * 5. Write a function that will return a chosen city's average temperature in
 *    either fahrenheit or celsius defined by two parameters as shown in the
 *    code below. Once you have written your function, it should output the
 *    right answer.
