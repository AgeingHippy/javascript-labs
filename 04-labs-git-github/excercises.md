* Take some time, as much time as you feel you need, to get organized for the course. Everyone has their own style for getting organized. Take as much time as you need.
* Create a new github repository and give it a name, something along the lines of "notes and snippets" or "code snips and notes" or "my code notes" - here you can keep your own notes and "code snippets" - most programmers spend much of their time searching Google for code snippets - examples of code that they can adapt to their task. If you start building your own library. Not only will your learning go much faster. You will also be much faster at coding than most, since you inimately know your own snippets, and they are available at your fingertips. Don't be afraid to copy and paste small sections of code into your notes too, just make sure you understand everything that is going in! Or at least make a note that you don't understand it!
