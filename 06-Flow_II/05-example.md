Now that you can `try` executing code and `catch` the errors so that they don't stop the program. Try implementing that into your temperature converter that deals with objects. Make a copy of the object and mess with it a little. Try spelling Fahrenheit or Celsius wrong in a few entries, or put in a string where a number is meant to be. Try running your existing script and see what happens. Once you get an error, try implement the try-catch block somewhere in your code to effectively skip over that entry.


### Research task

If you are curious about another type of for loop, check out the `for ... in` loop. See if you can find it in the MDN documentation and understand how it works. If you can come up with your own small working example, your own "hello world" of this syntax, you will well on your way to becoming a self-sufficient programmer!
