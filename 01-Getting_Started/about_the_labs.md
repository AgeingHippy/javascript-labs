## Markdown files

You may note that some files, like this one, in the labs are `.md` files. These are Markdown files. Markdown is a simple and easy-to-use markup language. Do you remember what HTML stands for? Hyper Text *Markup* Language.

> In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text. (Wikipedia)

Thing is, HTML is quite unreadable, the tags overwhelm the actual content. The advantage HTML has is that its flexible, you have as many tag types as you can think of. Though if you only really want stylings for a few headers, and your basic paragraph, then Markup cuts out the clutter and is easily convertible to HTML if you need to.
