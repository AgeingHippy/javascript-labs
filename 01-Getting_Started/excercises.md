# Getting into it

## 1 Get Organized

Take some time, as much time as you feel you need, to get organized for the course. Everyone has their own style for getting organized. Don't be afraid of taking a day or two. From your file system to your workspace, it's important to set up a physical working space, a virtual space in your computer, and a psychological space in your mind.


## 2 Create Habits

What to do when your motivation fades? Start listening to some programming podcasts on trips, while doing chores or exercise. Watch instructional YouTube videos when you need a break. Also, learn how to really rest when you need to, which sometimes means putting the phone down and just breathing for a while.

## 3 Post in the forums

Have a think about your goals, long and short term, and share them in the forum or Slack.

More often than not, the personal connections you make on courses is where real development happens.

## 4 Create Accounts

Get set up with some essential accounts for services you will be using again and again.
