Create a very basic site with a centered header with black text on a white background that says "Light Mode". At the bottom, make a button that says "Dark Mode". Using event listeners, make it so that when the button is pressed, the background goes black and the header goes white. Change the text in the header to "Dark Mode" and the text in the button to "Light Mode".
