A note about developing this project further. If you carry on making the page more complex, you should definitely think about creating two separate CSS files and manipulating the "link" element to dynamically switch the entire CSS from light mode to dark mode. If you want that as a feature of your web page.

Implementing a dark mode is something best left until last, because if you are making changes to your site, then you need to keep track of both CSS files which can get tedious very quickly. Best to build out your site with its default style and then once your main structure is solid, start adding the quality of life features. You can also look out for SASS, which is a way to use CSS with great features like variables!

This is tricky ground because there are many caveats and different approaches to do the same thing, so be ready to look stuff up frequently! Its also advisable to keep an empty text file open on your system to use as a sort of temporary copy and paste staging area, where you can paste snippets that you will adapt and refer back to the original.
