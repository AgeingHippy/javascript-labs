You will notice that in this section you don't have a test HTML anymore.

That's right, you will have to build your own!

First, to refresh your HTML and CSS, build a simple web page with an HTML file and a CSS file. Make it a mock up of a blog type page. Find an interesting article linked in the course or one chosen by you and copy the content from there. You page should have:

- A header at the top with a site title and a subtitle
- In the main section, an article title, an article subtitle and an article. The article should have some terms in bold and italics. It should contain a list and a table.
- The main section should have two sections, one that occupies 75% of the page from left to right and a side-bar that occupies the right hand 25%.
- A footer with a copyright stamp and the year.
- It should be styled according to your taste.

This will require a fair bit of HTML and CSS knowledge so if you need, take this free course
