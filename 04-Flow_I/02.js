/**
 * You will probably want to modify the html file to mute the output of certain
 * exercises, this one for instance, will generate many lines of output.
 *
 * 1. Create a for loop that will log all the numbers between 5 and 1000.
 *    incrementing in 5s. So the output would start "5, 10, 15, 20 .."
 * 2. Create a for loop that outputs every number between 100 and -100.
 * 3. Create a for loop that outputs this sequence of numbers: 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,
 *    9, 8 ... That is, starting at 0: +3, -1, +3, -1, +3
 *
 * This last one is tricky! You need to keep track of which iteration you are on
 * and the number to output separately.
