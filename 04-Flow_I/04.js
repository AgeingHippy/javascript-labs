/**
 * You have already made some functions for temperatures. Now you will
 * make some more
 *
 * 1. Research the formula for conversions to and from Kelvin. Write a
 *    KtoC, CtoK, FtoK and a KtoF function. Be sure to return the value
 *    so that the code below functions.
 *
 * 2. Research and write a function that uses the pythagorean formula to
 *    get the length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle. It
 *    should take in two arguments, the two shorter sides of a triangle,
 *    and return the longest side. Call the function "pythagoras". The
 *    code below should work.
 *
 *    You may need to research how to square a number and also how to
 *    find the square root of a number. Try and Google "square number
 *    javascript" and "square root javascript".
