/**
 * You have already made some functions for temperatures. Now you will make some
 * more
 *
 * 1. Research the formula for conversions to and from Kelvin. Write a KtoC,
 *    CtoK, FtoK and a KtoF function. Be sure to return the value so that the
 *    code below functions.
 *
 * 2. Research and write a function that uses the pythagorean formula to get the
 *    length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle. It should take in two
 *    arguments, the two shorter sides of a triangle, and return the longest
 *    side. Call the function "pythagoras". The code below should work.
 *
 *    You may need to research how to square a number and also how to find the
 *    square root of a number. Try and Google "square number javascript" and
 *    "square root javascript".
 *
 * 3. Research and write a functions to convert
 *      - inches to centimeters (inchToCm)
 *      - centimeters to inches (CmToInch)
 *      - miles to kilometers (MToKm)
 *      - kilometers to miles (KmToM)
 *
